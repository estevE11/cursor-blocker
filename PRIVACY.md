# Privacy Policy for Cursor Blocker

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Overview

Cursor Blocker is a productivity tool that blocks distracting websites when Cursor AI is not actively working. This privacy policy explains what data is collected and how it's used.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

Cursor Blocker collects and stores the following data **locally on your device**:

1. **Blocked Domains List** — The websites you configure to be blocked (default: x.com, twitter.com, youtube.com)
2. **Bypass State** — Whether you've used your daily emergency bypass, and when it expires
3. **Last Bypass Date** — The date of your last bypass usage (to enforce once-per-day limit)

### What We Don't Collect

- No browsing history
- No personal information
- No analytics or telemetry
- No usage statistics
- No data sent to external servers

## Data Storage

All data is stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API:

- **Local storage** — Data is stored on your device
- **Chrome sync** — If you have Chrome sync enabled, your blocked domains list will sync across your devices via your Google account
- **No external servers** — We do not operate any servers that receive your data

## Server Communication

The extension communicates only with a **local server running on your machine** (`localhost:8765`). This server:

- Runs entirely on your computer
- Never connects to the internet
- Connects to Cursor locally via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) on `127.0.0.1:9222` to determine whether Cursor AI is active

## Third-Party Services

Cursor Blocker does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking.

## Data Deletion

To delete all Cursor Blocker data:

1. Open Chrome extension settings
2. Click on Cursor Blocker → "Remove"
3. All locally stored data will be deleted

Alternatively, clear the extension's storage via Chrome DevTools.

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `storage` | Store your blocked domains list and bypass state |
| `tabs` | Send state updates to open tabs when blocking status changes |
| `<all_urls>` | Inject the blocking modal on any website you configure |

## Children's Privacy

Cursor Blocker is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.
